# utilities
a collection of various small utility scripts I've written for various Linux machines I've administered 

Unless otherwise specified they're released under the GPLv3 or later licence.

##Usage:
I usually put them in /usr/local/bin so that they're in the path but they could go anywhere really. They can be run as needed or
set to run as cron jobs as appropriate.

Some are clearly more useful than others. Really I'm just putting them here so I don't lose them again. :)
